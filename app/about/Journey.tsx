        My journey began in 2019 when I got accepted to Kabul University for
        software engineering. Then came challenges: COVID-19, a university
        attack, and the collapse of the government in 2021. I left college, but
        not my dream. With determination, I turned to the internet and taught
        myself full-stack development using FreeCodeCamp, YouTube, and tons of
        projects. Now, Iâ€™ve built 150+ projects, earned multiple certifications,
        and landed an internship, all self-driven.
